# Hybrid Theta*
This is a motion planning algorithm for vehicles with curvature constraints, such as minimum turn radius, a primary cost such as path length, and  a secondary cost such as resource cost. 
Inputs to the algorithm are: 
map with obstacles, risk field (resource cost), start and end configurations, minimum turn radius, resource cost limit
Output: minimum cost path satisfying curvature constraints and integral resource constraint
